# CTCL's Extras for People Playground
Mod for People Playground that adds in random objects to explore the possibilities of the game's 2D physics

Mostly adds objects for making mechanical "engines" along with some other items.

This project (if you would call it that) introduced me to C# programming and the Unity game engine.
